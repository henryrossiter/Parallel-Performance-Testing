This directory tree contains the examples for Using MPI, 2nd edition.

This collection uses configure to create the Makefiles that can be used to 
build and run the applications.  For example, to use MPICH, use

./configure --with-mpich

To use a specific MPICH, give the directory that contains the compilation
commands (e.g., mpicc):

./configure --with-mpich=/usr/local/mpich-1.2.1/bin

To use other implementation of MPI, use:

IBM:

./configure --with-ibmmpi

SGI:

./configure --with-sgimpi
